This is still Under Developement.This Demo Version is for you for testing and Checking.
I would like to thank you in advance to see my work.There are many little bugs that i will fix but 
I am currently Running out of time.

There are WebPmDB_log.ldf file that you have to attach it at making database connection .
You can check out Screenshot if you have any problem in linking Database.(because I have used a setting string.)

I would rather send you a complete setup file but I need you to see the code and there are many
 bugs in it so i need to fix it .

My app consues around 60 MB RAM .I dont Know Why but it consumes .Sometimes It wont go after i close the app. I need to close it from Task manager.

I have searched about chrome interface .somw web kit provides it but the Exam preparations are on my head
 so i didnt implement that

Hope You like it .
